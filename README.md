# pyproflosim

## Process Flow Simulator written in Python

Will eventually be able to simulate complex flow in industrial processes and make recommendations for improvement.

However, right now, it can calculate simple mass balances across a process.

Makes use of:

* [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html): symbolic algebra solver in python, BSD
* [PubChemPy](https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): PubChem chemical data API, MIT
